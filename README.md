## What is a CNN?

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks designed for tasks such as image recognition and analysis. It is particularly effective at capturing spatial hierarchies of features in data.

## Why CNNs?

- **Spatial Hierarchy:** CNNs are adept at learning hierarchical representations of features in spatial data, making them well-suited for image-related tasks.

- **Parameter Sharing:** CNNs use shared weights through convolutional filters, allowing them to generalize patterns across different spatial locations.

- **Translation Invariance:** CNNs exhibit translation invariance, meaning they can recognize patterns regardless of their position in the input.

## Key Components

### Convolutional Layer

The convolutional layer applies filters to input data to capture features.

### Pooling Layer

Pooling layers downsample the spatial dimensions, reducing the amount of computation and retaining important information.

### Fully Connected Layer

Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, forming the final classification output.
